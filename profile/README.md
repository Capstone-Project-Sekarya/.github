## Product-Based Capstone "Sekarya" - Mobile AI-powered application designed to be a platform for artists üëã
## Team ID: CH23-PS019

This project developed for the capstone project 

## üìñ Description :

The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed various fields, including art. AI can now be used to produce realistic and difficult-to-distinguish-from-human-made artworks. This poses a threat to artists, who are concerned that their work will be replaced by AI-generated works. From the problems that we have encountered, we have determined the main question that we need to solve: "What should be done to provide opportunities for artists to sell their work without having to worry about being outcompeted by AI-generated works?"
